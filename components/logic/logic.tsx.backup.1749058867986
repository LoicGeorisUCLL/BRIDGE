Here is the updated `generatePersonalizedTasks` function based on the new regulations:

```typescript
import { UserProfile } from "@/types";

export const generatePersonalizedTasks = (profile: UserProfile): string[] => {
  const allTasks = [];

  // All seasonal workers staying for more than 3 months must be registered with the local authorities (municipality)
  if (profile.duration === 1 || profile.duration === 2) {
    allTasks.push('municipality');
  }

  // All seasonal workers must have a valid work contract issued by their employer (contract)
  if (profile.contract === 0) {
    allTasks.push('contract');
  }

  // All seasonal workers must have health insurance coverage for the duration of their stay (health)
  allTasks.push('health');

  // All seasonal workers must have a bank account in the country of employment to receive their wages (bank)
  if (profile.bankAccount === 0) {
    allTasks.push('bank');
  }

  // Always add Annex 3 (bijlage3) for temporary residence document
  allTasks.push('bijlage3');

  // Always add emergency contact setup and practical information
  allTasks.push('emergency', 'practical');

  return allTasks;
};
```

Explanation of changes:

1. The condition for the "municipality" task has been updated to check if the user's stay duration is longer than 3 months (profile.duration === 1 || profile.duration === 2).
2. The condition for the "contract" task has been updated to check if the user does not have a valid work contract (profile.contract === 0).
3. The "health" task is now always included, as it is a mandatory requirement for all seasonal workers.
4. The condition for the "bank" task has been updated to check if the user does not have a Belgian bank account (profile.bankAccount === 0).
5. The "bijlage3", "emergency", and "practical" tasks are still included as before, as they are mandatory for all seasonal workers.
